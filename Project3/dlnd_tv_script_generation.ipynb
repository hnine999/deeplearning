    "It's ok if the TV script doesn't make any sense.  We trained on less than a megabyte of text.  In order to get good results, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary or get more data.  Luckly there's more data!  As we mentioned in the begging of this project, this is a subset of [another dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data).  We didn't have you train on all the data, because that would take too long.  However, you are free to train your neural network on all the data.  After you complete the project, of course.\n",
